# Intel Products Sentiment Analysis Project
### PS-11 Intel Products Sentiment Analysis from Online Reviews
## Overview
This project scrapes Amazon reviews for Intel processors, pre-processes the data, and applies machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis. We integrated Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization with Logistic Regression and utilized Word2Vec embeddings within a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for enhanced semantic understanding. Our workflow includes tokenization, cleaning with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training with Keras. Key takeaways on processor strengths and weaknesses were compiled for Intel engineers, along with performance analyses between Transformer and LSTM models. Additionally, word clouds and graphs were created to visualize insights, providing valuable data-driven perspectives.

### Instructions to Run
1. Go to the Python Notebook [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/GarvBhaskar/Intel-Product-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)
2. Inside your terminal, run the following command to install all required packages:
```bash
pip install scrapy pandas numpy ipykernel tensorflow keras langdetect logging scikit-learn nltk re beautifulsoup4 matplotlib seaborn collections
```
3. Use "Run all cells" command in notebook. 

## Proposed Solution

Our solution integrates TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression for baseline performance evaluation, leveraging Word2Vec embeddings initialized within an LSTM architecture for enhanced semantic understanding. We use NLTK for tokenization and cleaning, and TF-IDF for feature extraction. Logistic Regression is fine-tuned via GridSearchCV, and an LSTM model is trained in Keras with pretrained Word2Vec embeddings. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and visualizations like word clouds.

## Data Sources Used
Real-time reviews were collected from various e-commerce websites and social media platforms using web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.

## Analysis of LSTMs and Transformer Performance

### LSTMs:

**Strengths:**
- Well-suited for tasks where order and past information are critical (e.g., sentiment analysis).
- Relatively easy to implement and interpret.

**Weaknesses:**
- Can struggle with very long sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem.
- May not efficiently capture relationships between distant elements.

### Transformers:

**Strengths:**
- Excel at handling long sequences due to parallel processing and attention mechanism.
- Effective in learning relationships between distant elements.

**Weaknesses:**
- More computationally expensive to train compared to LSTMs.
- Interpretability can be challenging due to the "black box" nature of attention mechanisms.
